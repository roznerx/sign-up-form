# "Sign-up Form" for The Odin Project

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

## Notes [15/08/2022]:

- This is a brand new project in *The Odin Project* curriculum, added only a couple of weeks ago. I was already deep into the *Fullstack Javascript* path when the new changes were added, so I decided to go back and complete the new projects and lessons in order to learn more information about the basics. To keep it short, same thing as in https://github.com/roznerx/recipes and https://github.com/roznerx/landing-page , though I might give this one a little more effort ;)
